The Spirit of the Place
Travel is a source of new ideas and inspiration, because we are imbued with the mood and spirit of new places, their history. The viewer of the program «Spirit of the Place» will be alone with the remote corners of our planet (in Asia, Latin America, Antarctica), because the episodes do not contain a voiceover. It is an opportunity to enjoy travelling, music and Spirit of the Place. Nothing redundant!
